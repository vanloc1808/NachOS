# NachOS
We are from [fit@hcmus](https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/vn/), and this repository stores our projects for the Operating Systems (CSC10007) course.  
In this course, we implemented NachOS - a small operating system that was developed as a teaching tool to help students understand the basics of operating system design and implementation. 
In this NachOS project, we implemented the following things:
<ul>
  <li>Exceptions handling</li>
  <li>PC register increment</li>
  <li>Syscall ReadNum</li>
  <li>Syscall PrintNum</li>
  <li>Syscall RandomNum</li>
  <li>Syscall ReadChar</li>
  <li>Syscall PrintChar</li>
  <li>Syscall ReadString</li>
  <li>Syscall PrintString</li>
  <li>Copy from user space to kernel space and vice versa</li>
  <li>Syscall Create</li>
  <li>Syscall Open</li>
  <li>Syscall Close</li>
  <li>Syscall Read</li>
  <li>Syscall Write</li>
  <li>Syscall Seek</li>
  <li>Syscall Remove</li>
</ul>
